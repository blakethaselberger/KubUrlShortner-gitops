# Kubernetes Ingress Resource for URL Shortener
# ============================================================================
# This resource tells the AWS Load Balancer Controller:
# "Create an AWS ALB that routes traffic to my service"
#
# The controller (installed by Terraform) watches for this resource and
# automatically creates a real AWS ALB with all the configuration needed.

  # ========================================================================
  # These annotations tell the controller how to configure the ALB
  annotations:
    # Ingress class: tells Kubernetes which controller should handle this
    # "alb" means: use AWS Load Balancer Controller (not nginx ingress, etc.)

    # ====================================================================
    # ALB Configuration
    # ====================================================================

    # scheme: internet-facing = public ALB with internet IP
    # scheme: internal = private ALB only accessible within VPC
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing

    # target-type: ip = register pod IPs directly as targets
    # (as opposed to: instance = register EC2 instances)
    # We use 'ip' because Kubernetes manages pod IPs dynamically

    # Health Check Configuration
    # ====================================================================
    # The ALB uses these to determine if pods are healthy

    # Path the ALB checks to see if pod is healthy
    # Since /api/* routes to the API backend, the full path /api/health/ready
    # is sent to the backend (ALB does not strip the /api prefix)

    # Time (seconds) between health checks
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-interval-seconds: '15'

    # Time (seconds) to wait for health check response before timeout
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthcheck-timeout-seconds: '5'

    # Number of successful health checks before marking pod as healthy
    # 2 = pod must pass 2 checks in a row before getting traffic
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/healthy-threshold-count: '2'

    # Number of failed health checks before marking pod as unhealthy
    # 2 = pod is removed from ALB after 2 failed checks
